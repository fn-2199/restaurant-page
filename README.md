Project: Restaurant Page from TheOdinProject

This is the ninth project assigned by The Odin Project. The main purpose of this assignment was to learn how to organize our code with the tools we've been taught so far â€” webpack and ES6 modules. I realized now that a lot of modern websites are actually created this way compared to the structure we were taught earlier. As for now, I have the basic requirements out of the way. But in the future, I'd like to implement additional features that would animate elements that gets removed and added, hover/selected effects that would indicate which tab the user's currently on, and use an  interactive map instead of a photo of the location.
